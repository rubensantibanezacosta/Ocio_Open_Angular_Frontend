## REQUIREMENTS

### LOCATIONS

- Let people know quickly if the event is in Tenerife, Gran Canaria or virtual, in addition to maybe getting the statistics somewhere, as a ranking, as has been done for users with the most scored events. (It can serve to motivate those of one island or another if they see that some do more things than others)

-  Fields in the event card:

	- A Province/Island or "Zone" field, which can only have 3 options. TFE, GC and Virtual, to find out if the event is proposed in Tenerife, Gran Canaria or virtually. This info would be nice if it appeared on the main screen of the event.

	- A second field that is free and indicates the location (like the one in the prototype), and if it is virtual, it can indicate the link to the created video conference.

### IMAGES

- Have a preloaded gallery of images to be used in the Image field, and that they do not upload an image per event but can use images already uploaded by other colleagues in previous events. If you don't like any image in the library or there is no suitable image, then you can upload an image (and it becomes part of the image library).

### FORMS

- The option to unsubscribe from events must be taken into account, providing a reason.


### USERS

- Have a table of users. Every time an employee accesses the application, with the integration by Google, register him as a user in the table, if he is not previously present (it is the first time he enters the application) or, if he is already registered, update a field of the table that is last accessed. In ppo I would like to have in this table:
- 
	- User id, the email is good for me, it is unique.
	- date and time of first access.
	- date and time of last access


### NOTIFICATIONS

- To be able to make notifications by mail:

	- Every time an event is created, to all the mails that we have in the "users" table
	- Every time an event in which you have signed up is edited or canceled.
	- Every time a colleague joins/unsubscribes to an event that you have proposed or signed up for.


### ADMINISTRATION

- THave an administration section (for administrator roles) where, as a minimum, you can:
 	- EVENTS To be able to consult events and edit them (even if we are not the organizer).
 	- USERS To be able to consult the table of users, with their registration date, and their last connection time
